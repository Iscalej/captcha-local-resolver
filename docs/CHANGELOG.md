## About Semantic Versioning

The Semantic Versioning rules apply *only* to:

- The HTTP API
- The service startup (parameters to start the server)

In summary, [SemVer](https://semver.org/) can be viewed as `[ Breaking ].[ Feature ].[ Fix ]`, where:

- Breaking version = includes incompatible changes to the API
- Feature version = adds new feature(s) in a backwards-compatible manner
- Fix version = includes backwards-compatible bug fixes

**Version `0.x.x` doesn't have to apply any of the SemVer rules**  

## Version 0.0.1 2020-02-06

- Initial release
